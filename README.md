# Polynomial Integration

The aim of this c program is to provide the user of the program 3 different methods by which they can calculate a polynomial integral (up to the 4th order) e.g., _y = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d_.

The 3 methods are the following:
1. Trapezoidal rule
2. Simpson's rule
3. Algebraic integration

For methods 1 and 2, the limits of the integral are to be entered by the user and the result using that method is compared against the result using algebraic integration (most accurate result).
